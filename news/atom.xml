<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Lewis, who is based at the University of Birmingham and works
on the EPiCS project, visited Professor Marco Santambrogio at the NECST
Lab at the Politecnico di Milano on a Research Exchange visit. The
visit took place between the 19th and 21st March 2013, and enabled these
two active researchers in the field of self-aware computing to explore
several collaborations and areas for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lewis's work in the EPiCS project has been primarily concerned with
developing concepts and foundations for computational self-awareness. On
the conceptual side, his recent work includes the development of a
psychology-inspired conceptual framework for describing and comparing
computational self-awareness capabilities. On the foundational side, his
work has involved developing and applying novel nature-inspired learning
and adaptation algorithms to realise the vision of computational
self-awareness, e.g. in distributed smart camera networks. This work
forms a core aspect of the EPiCS project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lewis gave an invited talk, describing the developed conceptual
framework for computational self-awareness and how the capabilities it
describes it could be implemented. The talk generated a lively
discussion amongst researchers and students from disparate backgrounds
including electronic and computer engineering, context aware systems,
bioengineering and control theory. Several collaboration scoping
sessions were conducted, with researchers from a range of fields. In
particular, focus areas included how to apply meta-self-aware algorithm
selection to a self-adaptive fault tolerance problem, and the
relationship between computational self-awareness, context awareness and
control theory.&lt;/p&gt;

<published>2013-08-06T22:00:00Z</published><updated>2013-08-06T22:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.epics-project.eu/news/2013-08-07-Ella-Released/">
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ella, the Middleware developed in the EPiCS Project, has just been released as open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ella is a fully distributed publish/subscribe middleware enabling rapid development of data-driven distributed applications. Ella features a simple and fluent facade making it easy to use. A special focus in the design of the middleware has been put easy integration of Ella into existing code. It does not require any inheritance but instead uses code annotations to make classes suitable for use in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ella can be downloaded from &lt;a href="http://ella.codeplex.com"&gt;http://ella.codeplex.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><id>tag:www.epics-project.eu,2013-08-06:/news/2013-08-06-CAMSIM-Released/</id><title type="html">CamSim simulator for distributed camera networks released</title>
<published>2013-08-05T22:00:00Z</published><updated>2013-08-05T22:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.epics-project.eu/news/2013-08-06-CAMSIM-Released/">
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://epics.github.io/CamSim"&gt;CamSim&lt;/a&gt;, the simulator for distributed smart camera networks, has just been released in its first version. In the last few months, the pre-release of CamSim went through various major refactoring processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="center"&gt;
  &lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/70176909" width="500" height="292" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The key changes as well as benefits of CamSim are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Ease of generating test scenarios, with cameras and objects limited only by computer memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Camera behaviour, using an economic and pheromone inspired approach is implemented, as well as several communication policies. These approaches and communication policies are described in &lt;a href="/publications/2013_esterle_tosn.pdf"&gt;Socio-Economic Vision Graph Generation and Handover in Distributed Smart Camera Networks&lt;/a&gt; by Lukas Esterle, Peter R. Lewis, Xin Yao and Bernhard Rinner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Several bandit solvers are implemented to provide meta-management at the camera level, selecting between communication policies and auction strategies dynamically at runtime. This behaviour is described in &lt;a href="/publications/2013_lewis_saso.pdf"&gt;Learning to be Different: Heterogeneity and Efficiency in Distributed Smart Camera Networks&lt;/a&gt; by Peter R. Lewis, Lukas Esterle, Arjun Chandra, Bernhard Rinner and Xin Yao.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The motion behaviour of objects can be replaced using reflection mechanism. Besides prior known movements 'straight' and 'waypoints', where 'straight' defines movement in a straight line and random bouncing off the simulation boundary and 'waypoints' defines a movement along a predefined  path, another movement behaviour based on Brownian motion has been added to the collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; All aspects of camera behaviour, including bandit solvers, communication strategies and pheromone learning can be replaced using reflection mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To provide prospective developers with a low entrance level, abstract classes are available for extension. Furthermore, introductory tutorials are available online at the GitHub Repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first release can be downloaded from &lt;a href="https://github.com/EPiCS/CamSim/releases/tag/v1.0"&gt;https://github.com/EPiCS/CamSim/releases/tag/v1.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><id>tag:www.epics-project.eu,2013-08-01:/news/2013-08-20-Video-Challenge-Extended/</id><title type="html">EPiCS Video Student Contest, win 500€ in cash!</title>

&lt;figcaption style="text-align: left;"&gt;Object trajectories are analysed to perform classification, which allows cameras to communicate more efficiently. Here, Camera B can distinguish between objects heading in different directions to ensure only Camera A uses computational resources searching for the blue object. The addition of classification increases efficiency of multi-camera tracking relative to the state of the art.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Bernhard Dieber and I have recently started to work in the EPICS project. I am pursuing my PhD at the Alpen-Adria Universität Klagenfurt working in the group of Prof. Bernhard Rinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my research work I am working on resource awareness in visual sensor networks. In my previous project we have been working on a resource-aware sensor network tailored for deployment in areas with no infrastructure. We have built a camera network which is energy autarkic and can be powered from e.g. solar cells. Our use case in this project was the deployment of this network in a national park to detect events ranging from animal activity to intrusion detection, see &lt;a href="project%20website"&gt;http://srsnet.lakeside-labs.com&lt;/a&gt;. My part in this project was to design a distributed reconfiguration algorithm to configure the network for both, optimal performance and minimal energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the EPICS project I will be working on the resource-aware Middleware for camera networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to working with you in this exciting project.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><id>tag:www.epics-project.eu,2012-10-01:/news/2012-10-01-EPiCS-Software/</id><title type="html">EPiCS software webpage added</title>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://srcs12.doc.ic.ac.uk"&gt;2012 workshop on Self-Awareness in Reconfigurable Computing Systems (SRCS)&lt;/a&gt; was organised to bring together researchers who are active in the field of self-awareness, reconfigurable computing and related areas. Research on reconfigurable computing, involving technologies such as FPGAs, has long been concerned with reconfiguration and adaptation of circuits at run-time. Self-awareness is an emerging field of research that extends this line of research: it involves advanced concepts such as reasoning and learning in order to facilitate self- adaptation and self-optimisation. Self-awareness and the engineering of self-aware applications in the context of reconfigurable technology are also concepts that are fundamental to EPiCS. The workshop was initiated by members of the EPiCS consortium to achieve an active exchange between researchers to share their visions on general concepts and foundations of self-awareness as well as the practical transfer of these concepts to reconfigurable computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop received submissions from all over the world, and through peer-review, 6 were selected for regular presentation and 6 were selected for poster presentation. The workshop also included 3 invited talks from industry and academia. The workshop took place on 1. September in Oslo, Norway, co-located with the &lt;a href="http://fpl2012.org"&gt;2012 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)&lt;/a&gt;. The workshop was attended by 30 participants and featured a rich technical program followed by an extensive closing discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
