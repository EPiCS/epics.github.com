<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the project, several software projects have been developed. We are happy to announce that the results of several efforts have been released as open-source software. For providing a clear and compact presentation of all open-source software efforts within EPiCS, we have added a dedicated &lt;a href="/software"&gt;Software section&lt;/a&gt; to the EPiCS website.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><id>tag:www.epics-project.eu,2012-09-01:/news/2012-09-01-Vivek-Sabbnieni/</id><title type="html">Vivek Sabbineni joins the EPiCS team at EADS</title>

&lt;p&gt;Vivek Sabbieni has joined the EPiCS team at EADS. Vivek received his Master of Computer Science (2006) from Andhra University in India and then completed his Masters in System-on-Chip design (2009) at Lund University, Sweden. During his Master thesis studies he worked novel concepts for the architecture exploration of the ADRES processor from Inter University Micro Electronics Center (IMEC), Belgium.  After completing his master studies, he worked as a junior researcher (2010-2012) at the Barcelona Supercomputing center, Spain, on Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis for hard real time systems. His current research topics are reconfigurable computing systems, architectures for real time systems and fault tolerance for avionic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the EPiCS project Vivek will be responsible for investigating thread-level fault tolerance concepts for FPGA-based heterogeneous multi-core platforms comprising programmable and customised cores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the team!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><id>tag:www.epics-project.eu,2012-09-01:/news/2012-09-01-SRCS-Workshop/</id><title type="html">Workshop on Self-Awareness in Reconfigurable Computing Systems (SRCS) held in Oslo</title>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://srcs12.doc.ic.ac.uk"&gt;2012 workshop on Self-Awareness in Reconfigurable Computing Systems (SRCS)&lt;/a&gt; was organised to bring together researchers who are active in the field of self-awareness, reconfigurable computing and related areas. Research on reconfigurable computing, involving technologies such as FPGAs, has long been concerned with reconfiguration and adaptation of circuits at run-time. Self-awareness is an emerging field of research that extends this line of research: it involves advanced concepts such as reasoning and learning in order to facilitate self- adaptation and self-optimisation. Self-awareness and the engineering of self-aware applications in the context of reconfigurable technology are also concepts that are fundamental to EPiCS. The workshop was initiated by members of the EPiCS consortium to achieve an active exchange between researchers to share their visions on general concepts and foundations of self-awareness as well as the practical transfer of these concepts to reconfigurable computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop received submissions from all over the world, and through peer-review, 6 were selected for regular presentation and 6 were selected for poster presentation. The workshop also included 3 invited talks from industry and academia. The workshop took place on 1. September in Oslo, Norway, co-located with the &lt;a href="http://fpl2012.org"&gt;2012 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)&lt;/a&gt;. The workshop was attended by 30 participants and featured a rich technical program followed by an extensive closing discussion. The &lt;a href="http://srcs12.doc.ic.ac.uk/proceedings.html"&gt;workshop proceedings&lt;/a&gt; are available online.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><id>tag:www.epics-project.eu,2012-04-30:/news/2012-04-30-Awareness-Magazine-Plessl/</id><title type="html">Article on "Programming models for reconfigurable heterogeneous multi-cores" in Awareness Magazine</title>
