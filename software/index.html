<h3>ReconOS (<a href="http://github.com/EPiCS/reconos">http://github.com/EPiCS/reconos</a>)</h3>

<p>ReconOS is a programming model, an execution environment, an operating system
extension, a hardware architecture, a research project, and a development
playground.</p>

<p>Originally developed within the context of a university research project and a
PhD thesis, ReconOS is a way to bring some of the convenience of a software-like
programming model to the detail-ridden world of dynamically reconfigurable
hardware design. With ReconOS, you can model a concurrent application for
reconfigurable systems-on-chip (rSoC) using both software and hardware threads.
The interactions between all threads are handled through common POSIX-like
abstractions such as mailboxes, semaphores, or shared memory, hiding the
complexities of bus access protocols, memory spaces, register files and
interrupt handling.</p>

<p>ReconOS also includes a dynamic network protocol stack developed by ETH Zurich.</p>

<h3>Netsniff-NG (<a href="https://github.com/borkmann/netsniff-ng">https://github.com/borkmann/netsniff-ng</a>)</h3>

<p>For development, performance testing and debugging purposes of the dynamic
protocol stack that is part of ReconOS, ETH Zurich has developed a
high-performance networking toolkit. The gain of the toolkit's performance
is reached by zero-copy mechanisms, so that on packet reception and
transmission the kernel does not need to copy packets from kernel space to
user space and vice versa.</p>

<p>Besides others, netsniff-ng contains a protocol analyzer, network traffic
generator and top-like statistic tools in order to facilitate the protocol
stack's development.</p>

<h3>OpenTLD (<a href="http://gnebehay.github.com/OpenTLD">http://gnebehay.github.com/OpenTLD</a>)</h3>

<p>
This software repository contains both an application and a library that can be used for tracking a single object in a video stream. The underlying algorithm assumes only a minimum amount of a priori information in the form of a user-provided bounding box and does not depend on any kind of training data. This implementation of OpenTLD is based solely on open source libraries, meaning that you do not need any commercial products to compile or run it. Supported platforms are Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
</p>

<h3>CamSim (<a href="http://github.com/EPiCS/CamSim">http://github.com/EPiCS/CamSim</a>)</h3>

<p>
To test and evaluate different strategies for tracking coordination in distributed smart cameras, Klagenfurt University and University of Birmingham have developed a simulation environment. The environment allows to evaluate different strategies for handover using different communication approaches in various scenarios. Besides random and the predefined scenarios, user can create their own scenarios using XML, to test different strategies.
