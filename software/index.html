<h3>ReconOS (<a href="http://github.com/EPiCS/reconos">http://github.com/EPiCS/reconos</a>)</h3>

<p>ReconOS is a programming model, an execution environment, an operating system
extension, a hardware architecture, a research project, and a development
playground.</p>

<p>Originally developed within the context of a university research project and a
PhD thesis, ReconOS is a way to bring some of the convenience of a software-like
programming model to the detail-ridden world of dynamically reconfigurable
hardware design. With ReconOS, you can model a concurrent application for
reconfigurable systems-on-chip (rSoC) using both software and hardware threads.
The interactions between all threads are handled through common POSIX-like
abstractions such as mailboxes, semaphores, or shared memory, hiding the
complexities of bus access protocols, memory spaces, register files and
interrupt handling.</p>

<p>ReconOS also includes a dynamic network protocol stack developed by ETH Zurich.</p>

<h3>FPGA Heater Cores (<a href="http://www.epics-project.eu/fpga-heater">http://www.epics-project.eu/fpga-heater</a>)</h3>

<p>
In the publication ``M. Happe, H. Hangmann, A. Agne, and C. Plessl. <i>Eight ways to put your FPGA on fire – a systematic study of heat generators.</i> In Proc. Int. Conf. on ReConFigurable Computing and FPGAs (ReConFig), pages 1–8. IEEE Computer Society, Dec. 2012.'', which won the best paper award at the ReConFig'2012 conference, University of Paderborn has presented a study on the systematic design and evaluation of circuits that are optimised for generating a maximum amount of heat on FPGAs. Such heater cores can be used for automatically generating and calibrating thermal models of FPGA devices. Also the heater cores can be used to expose distinct areas of the devices to high temperatures with the objective to induce soft-errors, due to an increase in switching time.
</p>

<p>
To make the heater cores available for other researchers for experimentation, we have released them as pcore modules, that can be integrated as components in Xilinx FPGA designs. The amount of heat that is generated can be adjusted in 32 levels.
</p>


<h3>Netsniff-NG (<a href="https://github.com/borkmann/netsniff-ng">https://github.com/borkmann/netsniff-ng</a>)</h3>

<p>For development, performance testing and debugging purposes of the dynamic
protocol stack that is part of ReconOS, ETH Zurich has developed a
high-performance networking toolkit. The gain of the toolkit's performance
is reached by zero-copy mechanisms, so that on packet reception and
transmission the kernel does not need to copy packets from kernel space to
user space and vice versa.</p>

<p>Besides others, netsniff-ng contains a protocol analyzer, network traffic
generator and top-like statistic tools in order to facilitate the protocol
stack's development.</p>

<h3>OpenTLD (<a href="http://gnebehay.github.com/OpenTLD">http://gnebehay.github.com/OpenTLD</a>)</h3>

<p>
This software repository contains both an application and a library that can be used for tracking a single object in a video stream. The underlying algorithm assumes only a minimum amount of a priori information in the form of a user-provided bounding box and does not depend on any kind of training data. This implementation of OpenTLD is based solely on open source libraries, meaning that you do not need any commercial products to compile or run it. Supported platforms are Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
</p>

<h3>CamSim (<a href="http://github.com/EPiCS/CamSim">http://github.com/EPiCS/CamSim</a>)</h3>

<p>
To test and evaluate different strategies for tracking coordination in distributed smart cameras, Klagenfurt University and University of Birmingham have developed a simulation environment. The environment allows to evaluate different strategies for handover using different communication approaches in various scenarios. Besides random and the predefined scenarios, user can create their own scenarios using XML, to test different strategies.
</p>

	Results of our evaluation have been published in:

<h3>Ella (<a href="http://ella.codeplex.com/">http://ella.codeplex.com/</a>)</h3>

<p>
  Ella is a fully distributed publish/subscribe middleware written in pure C# and compatible with Mono. Ella handles all the communication needed to transfer data from a producer to a consumer with no need to care if both are on the same or on different nodes in your network. Automatic node discovery and node failure handling are part of the middleware.
</p>
<p>
  Ella is based on the type-based pub/sub flavour because it is most intuitive to handle and does not require topic conventions (in topic-based pub/sub) or a dedicated query mechanism for properties (in case of content-based pub/sub).</p>


<h3>ProprioSimEnv (<a href="http://github.com/EPiCS/ProprioSimEnv">http://github.com/EPiCS/ProprioSimEnv</a>)</h3>

<p>
ProprioSimEnv is a modelling and simulation environment for proprioceptive computing nodes, computing nodes that have self-aware and self-expressive features. The general structure of a proprioceptive computing node realised by ProprioSimEnv is based on the EPiCS reference architecture and implemented in SystemC. Transaction Level Modelling (TLM) has been chosen as abstraction level for modelling and simulation to separate the details of the communication between modules, from the details of the implementation of the modules and the details of the overall communication structure.
</p>
<p>
All components of a proprioceptive node have been realised as dedicated SystemC modules to allow the user for composing their specific system to study self-awareness and self-expression.
