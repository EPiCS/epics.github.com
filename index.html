  <h1>What is the EPiCS research project?</h1>
  <p>
    EPiCS is a trans-national multi-disciplinary research project which aims at laying the foundation for engineering the novel class of proprioceptive computing systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proprioceptive computing systems collect and maintain information about their state and progress, which enables self-awareness by reasoning about their behaviour, and self- expression by effectively and autonomously adapt their behaviour to changing conditions. Concepts of self-awareness and self-expression are new to the domains of computing and networking; the successful transfer and development of these concepts will help create future heterogeneous and distributed systems capable of efficiently responding to a multitude of requirements with respect to functionality and flexibility, performance, resource usage and costs, reliability and safety, and security.
  </p>
  <p>
    Innovations from EPiCS are based on systematic integration of research in concepts and foundations for self-aware and self-expressive systems with novel hardware/software platform technologies and architectures for engineering autonomic compute nodes and networks. EPiCS drives and validates the research by the requirements of three challenging application domains that cover both high-end computers and embedded systems, as well as embeddings into technical and non- technical contexts.
